# gnewsrss

This is a basic tool to filter political news from Google News.  Google News
doesn't give you much control over what you don't want to see.  In my case, I
don't want to see political news so this tool will get the news headlines from
Google News' RSS feeds, send the headlines to an LLM to remove political news
and publish the remaining headlines (and links) to a web page that can be hosted
somewhere to be accessed.
